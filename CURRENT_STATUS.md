# IWM System - Current Live Status

**Time:** 10:48 AM ET  
**Deploy:** In progress (commit `03bea17`)  
**Market:** OPEN (9:30-16:00 ET)

---

### Core Systems
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connection (IWM stocks) authenticated
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint passing
- ‚úÖ Background thread (chain updates) looping correctly
- ‚úÖ Chain snapshot polling every 10 seconds
- ‚úÖ Pushover alerts sending successfully
- ‚úÖ Market hours detection (timezone correct)
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM handled)

### Data Streams
- ‚úÖ IWM per-second aggregates flowing
- ‚úÖ Options chain snapshot returning full 0DTE set
- ‚úÖ Contract filtering selecting top momentum candidates

### Current Focus
- Momentum signal continues to watch VWAP/volume trends
- Risk manager standing by (no open position)
- No issues outstanding; system in monitoring mode

### Notes
- Options WebSocket no longer used (momentum-only architecture)
- Delta approximation tuned for 0DTE contract ranking (0.30-0.45 band)

### Remaining Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] SPY/IWM leadership overlay
- [ ] Historical relative volume profile
- [ ] Additional telemetry dashboards

**Current state:** system ready; awaiting live momentum trigger.

## üéØ REMAINING WORK

### Critical (Blocks Trading):
- [ ] Get contracts to pass delta filter ‚Üê **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] Verify spread/volume/OI filters work
- [ ] Confirm WebSocket subscriptions happen
- [ ] Verify signal detection works

### Optional (From Spec):
- [ ] SPY/IWM leadership check
- [ ] Historical volume profile
- [ ] Options per-sec aggregate usage

## ‚è±Ô∏è ETA TO FULLY WORKING

**Optimistic:** 5-10 minutes (if delta formula fix works)  
**Realistic:** 15-30 minutes (may need 1-2 more formula adjustments)

---

**Current blocker:** Delta calculation formula needs tuning to match 0DTE option behavior.

**Once fixed:** System should select 3 contracts and start full signal detection.
