## 🎯 WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES NOW

**PURE MOMENTUM STRATEGY:**

3. Finds best 0DTE call contract
4. Sends BUY alert to phone
5. Tracks position with simple exits
6. Sends SELL alert when momentum lost

---

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Deploy Fails:
1. Check Render build logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure Polygon API key is valid (Starter+ plan)

### If System Doesn't Start:
1. Check logs for "Configuration errors"
2. Verify all 3 API keys are set
3. Check Polygon subscription level

### If No Signals During Market Hours:
- This is normal - system waits for TRUE momentum
- Simplified logic should generate more signals than before
- Check logs for "MOMENTUM SIGNAL" entries
