## ⚡ SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS

| Component | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Main loop | 1.0s | 0.5s | 2x faster |
| HTTP timeout | 5s | 2s | 2.5x faster |
| Alert timeout | 5s | 3s | 1.7x faster |

**Total latency reduction:** ~3-4 seconds per signal cycle

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

### When IWM Shows Momentum:
1. **VWAP signal fires** (price > VWAP, rising, volume surge)
2. **Query best contract** (from the 3 tracked, pick best delta/spread)
3. **Send BUY alert** instantly via Pushover
4. **Track position** (peak, giveback, time)
5. **Send SELL alert** when exit triggers
6. **Update lifetime P&L** (persists to disk)

---

## 📊 WHAT MAKES IT PROFESSIONAL

### Entry Discipline
- ✅ VWAP-based (price above 1-min VWAP)
- ✅ Volume confirmation (95th percentile)
- ✅ Positive momentum slope
- ✅ Time filters (no entry after 15:30)

### Exit Management
- ✅ Adaptive trailing (30% hard giveback)
- ✅ VWAP-based giveback (20% while below VWAP)
- ✅ VWAP persistence timeout (2 × 30s blocks)
- ✅ Time stop (15:55 mandatory close)

### Risk Controls
- ✅ Giveback caps (prevent round-trips)
- ✅ Position tracking (peak mark monitoring)
- ✅ Critical loss alerts (-$500 threshold)
- ✅ Lifetime performance tracking
