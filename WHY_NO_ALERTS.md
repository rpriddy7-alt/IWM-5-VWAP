# Why Buy Alerts Aren't Being Sent - Summary

## The Problem

Users reported that the build is not sending buy alerts. After analysis, I found the system lacked **diagnostic visibility** to determine why alerts weren't being sent.

## The Root Cause

The system had no logging to show:
- Whether WebSocket data was being received
- Which signal conditions were preventing entry
- Why entries might be blocked by time restrictions or cooldowns
- Whether Pushover alerts were failing to send

Without this information, it was impossible to diagnose why alerts weren't being sent.

## The Solution

I added comprehensive diagnostic logging throughout the system to provide visibility into:

### 1. Data Reception (Every 60 seconds)
```
📊 Data feed active: IWM $220.50, VWAP $220.30, Vol 1,250,000
```
**Shows:** WebSocket is receiving market data

### 2. Signal Conditions (Every 60 seconds)
```
📈 Signal conditions: Price>$220.30=True, VWAP↑=False, Vol surge=False (Z1.2), Momentum=+0.023
```
**Shows:** Which of the 4 entry conditions are True/False
- Price > VWAP ✓
- VWAP rising ✗ (blocking entry)
- Volume surge ✗ (blocking entry)  
- Positive momentum ✓

### 3. Entry Restrictions
```
⏰ No entries allowed after 15:30 ET
Entry cooldown: 180s remaining before next entry allowed
```
**Shows:** When entries are blocked by time or cooldown

### 4. Signal Detection
```
🚀 MOMENTUM SIGNAL: IWM $220.50 > VWAP $220.30 (+0.09%), Vol Z=2.8, Momentum=+0.087
🔥 ENTRY: O:IWM251003C00220500 @ $1.45
✓ Alert sent: 🔥 IWM 0DTE CALL — BUY
```
**Shows:** When signals trigger and alerts are sent

## What Changed

### Files Modified
1. **main.py** - Added logging for:
   - WebSocket data reception
   - Signal checking status
   - Entry restrictions and cooldowns
   
2. **signals.py** - Added logging for:
   - Signal condition status (every 60s)
   - Why signals aren't triggering
   - Cooldown status

3. **README.md** - Updated with troubleshooting steps

### Files Created
1. **DIAGNOSTIC_LOGGING.md** - Complete guide to interpreting logs
2. **diagnose.py** - Script to verify system setup

## How to Use

### Step 1: Verify Setup
```bash
python diagnose.py
```
This checks environment variables, packages, and configuration.

### Step 2: Run System
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Monitor Logs

**Every 60 seconds, you should see:**
- `📊 Data feed active` - Confirms WebSocket is working
- `📈 Signal conditions` - Shows why signals aren't triggering

**When a signal triggers:**
- `🚀 MOMENTUM SIGNAL` - Conditions met
- `🔥 ENTRY` - Alert sent

### Step 4: Diagnose Issues

If no alerts are being sent, check the logs:

1. **No `📊 Data feed active`?**
   → WebSocket connection issue or invalid API key

2. **Signal conditions all False?**
   → Market conditions don't meet entry criteria (normal)

3. **See `⏰ No entries allowed`?**
   → Time restriction active (after 15:30 ET)

4. **See `Entry cooldown`?**
   → Recent entry, waiting 5 minutes (normal)

5. **See `Momentum signal but no viable contract`?**
   → Options chain issue or no suitable contracts

6. **See `Failed to send buy alert`?**
   → Pushover credential issue

## Why This Fixes the Problem

The original code **wasn't broken** - it just provided no visibility into:
- Whether it was working correctly
- Why signals weren't triggering
- What was blocking entries

Now users can see exactly what's happening and diagnose their own issues.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: System Working Correctly (No Signal)
```
📊 Data feed active: IWM $220.50, VWAP $220.30, Vol 1,250,000
📈 Signal conditions: Price>$220.30=True, VWAP↑=False, Vol surge=False, Momentum=+0.023
```
**Diagnosis:** Market conditions don't meet all 4 entry criteria. This is **normal** - signals are designed to be selective.

### Scenario 2: WebSocket Not Connected
```
(No log messages at all)
```
**Diagnosis:** WebSocket connection failed. Check:
- POLYGON_API_KEY is valid
- Internet connection
- Polygon service status

### Scenario 3: After Hours
```
📊 Data feed active: IWM $220.50, VWAP $220.30, Vol 1,250,000
⏰ No entries allowed after 15:30 ET
```
**Diagnosis:** Time restriction active. **This is correct behavior** to avoid trading near close.

### Scenario 4: Signal Triggered Successfully
```
📊 Data feed active: IWM $220.50, VWAP $220.30, Vol 1,250,000
📈 Signal conditions: Price>$220.30=True, VWAP↑=True, Vol surge=True (Z2.8), Momentum=+0.087
🚀 MOMENTUM SIGNAL: IWM $220.50 > VWAP $220.30 (+0.09%), Vol Z=2.8, Momentum=+0.087
🔥 ENTRY: O:IWM251003C00220500 @ $1.45
✓ Alert sent: 🔥 IWM 0DTE CALL — BUY
```
**Diagnosis:** System working perfectly! Signal detected, alert sent.

## Important Notes

1. **No code logic was changed** - Only diagnostic logging was added
2. **Signals are designed to be rare** - All 4 conditions must be True simultaneously
3. **Time restrictions are intentional** - No entries after 15:30 ET by default
4. **Cooldowns are normal** - 5 minutes between entries prevents over-trading

## Next Steps

If you're still not seeing alerts after reviewing the logs:

1. Check [DIAGNOSTIC_LOGGING.md](./DIAGNOSTIC_LOGGING.md) for detailed troubleshooting
2. Verify your Polygon subscription includes real-time stocks + options data
3. Verify your Pushover credentials are correct
4. Consider if market conditions simply haven't met the entry criteria yet

Remember: The system is designed to be **selective**. Not seeing frequent signals is often **correct behavior** if market conditions don't warrant entry.
