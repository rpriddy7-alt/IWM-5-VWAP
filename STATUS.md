# üö® CURRENT BUILD STATUS - IWM 0DTE MOMENTUM SYSTEM

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Agent Session:** This document created before Cursor restart for Render integration  
**Build Status:** ‚úÖ **SKELETON COMPLETE - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

---

## üìã WHAT THIS SYSTEM IS

**IWM 0DTE CALLS MOMENTUM SYSTEM (SIMPLIFIED)**
- Real-time trading alert system for IWM same-day expiry CALL options
- Uses price momentum relative to VWAP with volume confirmation
- Sends BUY/SELL alerts to mobile via Pushover
- Designed to run 24/7 on Render as Background Worker
- Alerts only, no auto-trading

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (FOR NEXT AGENT)

### IMMEDIATE: Deploy to Render

1. **Verify GitHub Push Complete**
   ```bash
   git status  # Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
   git log --oneline -1  # Should show latest commit
   ```

2. **Connect to Render** (user will provide access)
   - Use Render MCP tools if available
   - Or guide user through dashboard manually

3. **Create Background Worker**
   - Name: `iwm-momentum-system`
   - Type: Background Worker
   - Repo: This GitHub repo (IWM-MAIN branch)
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start: `python main.py`

4. **Set Environment Variables in Render**
   ```
   POLYGON_API_KEY=<user will provide>
   PUSHOVER_TOKEN=<user will provide>
   PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=<user will provide>
   ```

5. **Deploy & Monitor**
   - Watch logs for startup sequence
   - Verify WebSocket connections
   - Confirm Pushover alert sent

---

## üîë CRITICAL INFORMATION

### Required API Credentials (USER MUST PROVIDE)

1. **Polygon.io API Key**
   - User should have this already
   - MUST be Starter plan or higher (not Free tier)
   - MUST have real-time WebSocket access enabled
   - Format: `pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

2. **Pushover Credentials**
   - Token: App token from Pushover dashboard
   - User Key: User key from Pushover dashboard
   - Format: `axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (token), `uxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (user)

### System Architecture

```
main.py (orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Connects stocks WebSocket ‚Üí IWM per-second aggregates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Polls REST every 10s ‚Üí options chain snapshot for liquidity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Background thread: chain updater
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main loop:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check entry signal (momentum)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Monitor active position
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Force exit at 15:55 ET
```

### Signal Logic

**Momentum signal:**
- Price above 1-min VWAP
- VWAP rising (30s)
- Volume surge (95th percentile)
- Positive linear price momentum

### Exit Triggers
1. Hard giveback ‚â• 30%
2. Giveback ‚â• 20% while below VWAP
3. Below VWAP for 2 √ó 30s blocks
4. Stop loss -15%
5. Time stop 15:55 ET

---

## üèóÔ∏è DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Why Momentum-Only?
- Clean, fast, resilient
- Price action leads; volume confirms
- No dependence on options flow availability
- Less API resource usage, lower failure rate

### Why 0DTE Only?
- Max gamma sensitivity
- Clear time decay
- Forces discipline (no overnight risk)

### Why CALLS Only?
- Directional bias clear
- Matches momentum thesis
- Liquidity concentrated on call side during momentum moves

### Why Adaptive Exits?
- Static stops choke winners
- Static targets miss runners
- VWAP-based giveback keeps profits while momentum persists

---

## üìä WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT RUNS

### During Market Hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
1. Polls chain every 10s ‚Üí selects top contracts
2. Streams IWM aggregates (price, VWAP, volume)
3. Checks momentum conditions continuously
4. When signal fires ‚Üí sends BUY alert
5. Tracks position with giveback/VWAP/time rules
6. Sends SELL alert upon exit condition
7. Forces flat at 15:55 ET

### Outside Market Hours
- System sleeps (checks every 60s)
- WebSocket may be idle; no signal checks
- Minimal API usage

### On Startup
- Sends Pushover: "System started at HH:MM:SS ET"

### On Shutdown
- Closes any open position
- Sends Pushover: "System stopped at HH:MM:SS ET"

## üö® KNOWN ISSUES / TODO

### Not Implemented Yet
- [ ] SPY/IWM leadership check (requires SPY feed - low priority)
- [ ] Historical volume profile for relative volume (using Z-score proxy)
- [ ] Auto-restart on WebSocket disconnect (relies on Render's process management)

### Works But Could Enhance
- Momentum slope smoothing (currently simple linear regression)
- Chain snapshot freshness (currently 60s max age, could tighten to 30s)
- Anti-chop filters (relative volume using Z-score, could add historical profile)

### Not Issues
- websocket-client warnings in logs ‚Üí normal, ignore
- Chain snapshot 429 errors ‚Üí rate limit, system handles gracefully
- Data stalls outside market hours ‚Üí expected, not a problem

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### "Failed to authenticate WebSocket"
- Invalid API key OR
- Polygon plan insufficient OR
- Key doesn't have WebSocket access

**Fix:** Verify at polygon.io/dashboard, regenerate key if needed

### "Chain snapshot returned no data"
- Outside market hours (normal) OR
- 0DTE not listed yet (early morning) OR
- Polygon API issue (check status.polygon.io)

### No alerts received
- Pushover credentials wrong OR
- Device not enabled in Pushover dashboard OR
- Pushover app not installed
- Momentum conditions not satisfied (quiet session)

**Test:** Send curl test to Pushover API (see QUICKSTART.md)

### Data stall warnings
- Temporary network hiccup (auto-recovers) OR
- Persistent connection issue (restart system)

## üìÇ GITHUB STATUS

**Repository:** This directory  
**Branch:** IWM-MAIN  
**Commit Status:** Should be pushed after this document created

**To verify:**
```bash
git remote -v  # Should show GitHub remote
git branch  # Should show IWM-MAIN
git status  # Should be clean after push
```

## üé¨ RENDER DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deploy
- [x] All code complete
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] render.yaml configured
- [ ] GitHub pushed ‚Üê NEXT AGENT VERIFY THIS
- [ ] API credentials ready (user provides)

### Deploy Steps
1. [ ] Connect Render to GitHub repo
2. [ ] Create Background Worker
3. [ ] Set environment variables
4. [ ] Deploy
5. [ ] Verify logs show startup
6. [ ] Confirm Pushover alert received
7. [ ] Monitor during market hours

### Post-Deploy
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections in logs
- [ ] Confirm chain snapshot polling working
- [ ] Watch for signal activity
- [ ] Test full buy/sell cycle (if signals appear)

---

## üí° FOR THE NEXT AGENT

**Your mission:**
1. Verify this code is pushed to GitHub
2. Connect to Render (user will provide access)
3. Deploy as Background Worker
4. Set the 3 required env vars (user will provide)
5. Monitor startup and verify system online
6. Confirm Pushover alerts working

**Critical files to understand:**
- `main.py` - Entry point, orchestrates everything
- `config.py` - All configuration lives here
- `signals.py` - Core signal logic
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step Render guide

**Testing during market hours:**
- System should log signal checks every second
- Chain updates every 10 seconds
- If volatile day, may see signals align
- If quiet day, may see "near misses" (2/3 conditions)

**Success criteria:**
- ‚úÖ System starts without errors
- ‚úÖ WebSockets connected
- ‚úÖ Pushover startup alert received
- ‚úÖ Chain snapshot polling working
- ‚úÖ Logs show signal monitoring active

---

## üîê SECURITY NOTES

- Never commit .env to GitHub (already in .gitignore)
- Use Render's environment variables for secrets
- API keys should be read-only where possible
- Pushover token is app-specific (can regenerate if leaked)

---

## üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

**Normal Day:**
- 0-3 BUY signals (most days)
- More on volatile days
- Zero on choppy/rangebound days
- System runs continuously, sleeps outside market hours

**Resource Usage:**
- CPU: Low (~5-10% on Render Standard)
- RAM: ~200-300 MB
- Network: Moderate (WebSocket streams)
- Polygon API: ~6 REST calls/min + WebSocket data

**Latency:**
- Signal detection: <1 second after data arrives
- Alert delivery: 1-3 seconds via Pushover
- Total entry lag: ~2-5 seconds from market event to alert

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL STATUS

**BUILD: COMPLETE**  
**TESTED: Syntax verified, components instantiate**  
**READY: For deployment to Render**  
**BLOCKED: Needs API credentials from user**

**NEXT AGENT: Push to GitHub, then deploy to Render**

_End of status document. All information needed for deployment is in this file and the documentation files._

**Good luck! üöÄ**
