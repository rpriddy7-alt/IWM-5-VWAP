## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

### **üî• THE ISSUE IS NOT THE KEY - IT'S THE ACCOUNT LIMIT**

**Even with a new key, you're still hitting the connection limit because:**

1. **Same Polygon Account**: Both keys are on the same Polygon account
2. **Account-Level Limit**: Connection limits are per account, not per key
3. **Old System Running**: Original IWM-Momentum-System still active
4. **Multiple Instances**: Render may be creating multiple instances
