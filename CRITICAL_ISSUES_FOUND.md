# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND IN IWM MOMENTUM SYSTEM

## Date: October 2, 2025
## Status: âœ… ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Summary
- Legacy flow/skew logic removed; system is now pure momentum (VWAP + volume + slope).
- Options WebSocket dependencies removed (stocks aggregates + REST snapshots only).
- Risk manager and alerts simplified to match new architecture.
- SciPy dependency eliminated (custom numpy-based regression).

---

## âœ… WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Main event loop
   - WebSocket connections
   - Polygon REST client
   - Pushover alerts
   - Position tracking
   - Risk management (giveback, stops)

2. **VWAP Signal Logic**
   - Per-second price tracking
   - VWAP calculation
   - Volume surge detection
   - This is the ONLY signal we need!

3. **Contract Selection**
   - Good logic for finding best 0DTE contracts
   - Delta, spread, volume filters working

---

## âœ… FIXES IMPLEMENTED

1. **Signal Simplification**
   - Removed OptionsFlowSignal, SkewSignal, SignalCoordinator.
   - `signals.py` now keeps only `MomentumSignal` and `SimpleExitMonitor`.

2. **Entry Logic**
   - Entry requires price above VWAP, VWAP rising, volume surge (95th percentile), positive slope.
   - No flow/skew data fetched or processed.

3. **Exit Logic**
   - Risk manager focuses on peak tracking; `SimpleExitMonitor` handles giveback/VWAP/time/stop.
   - Flow score and skew exits removed.

4. **Configuration Cleanup**
   - Removed flow/skew environment variables; config reflects momentum-only parameters.

5. **Alert Rework**
   - BUY alerts cite momentum metrics; SELL alerts unchanged aside from config references.

6. **Tests & Verify**
   - `verify.py` and `test_system.py` updated to match new dependencies.
   - SciPy removed from `requirements.txt` and scripts.

## ðŸš€ RESULT

System now matches the pure momentum design goal. All critical issues logged here have been resolved and validated.
