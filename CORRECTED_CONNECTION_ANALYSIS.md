# üîç CORRECTED CONNECTION ANALYSIS

## üéØ **STATUS: FOUND THE REAL ISSUE**

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Time**: 12:05 AM ET  
**Status**: üö® **BOTH SYSTEMS RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY**

---

## üîç **ACTUAL SITUATION**

### **‚úÖ BOTH SYSTEMS ARE RUNNING**
1. **IWM-5-VWAP (NEW)**: `srv-d3opd3k9c44c738d11f0` - **RUNNING**
2. **IWM-Multi-Strategy (OLD)**: `srv-d3f5ngpr0fns73d9mfp0` - **RUNNING**

### **‚úÖ BOTH USING SAME POLYGON KEY**
- **Both systems** are using the same Polygon API key
- **Both systems** are trying to connect to Polygon WebSocket
- **Connection limit** is being exceeded by having both active

---

## üîç **EVIDENCE FROM LOGS**

### **‚úÖ NEW SYSTEM LOGS**
```
WS Status [stocks]: max_connections - Maximum number of websocket connections exceeded.
You have reached the connection limit for your account.
```

### **‚úÖ OLD SYSTEM LOGS**
```
‚úì Corrected alert sent: ü§ñ IWM Multi-Strategy System Alert
Entering CORRECTED multi-strategy main loop...
```

**Both systems are actively running and trying to use Polygon!**

---

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED**

### **üî• THE ISSUE IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID**
**Both systems are running simultaneously:**
- **‚úÖ New System**: IWM-5-VWAP (trying to connect)
- **‚úÖ Old System**: IWM-Multi-Strategy (already connected)
- **‚ùå Connection Limit**: Exceeded by both systems

### **üî• POLYGON SHOWS "ONE CONNECTION" BECAUSE**
**The old system is already connected, so when the new system tries to connect, it gets rejected!**

---

## üö® **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

### **‚úÖ SUSPEND THE OLD SYSTEM**
**You need to suspend the old system to free up the connection:**

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3f5ngpr0fns73d9mfp0
2. **Click**: "Suspend" button
3. **Result**: New system will connect immediately
4. **Benefit**: No data loss, can be resumed later

### **‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE: DELETE OLD SYSTEM**
**If you don't need the old system:**
1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3f5ngpr0fns73d9mfp0
2. **Click**: "Delete" button
3. **Result**: Permanently frees up connection

---

## üéØ **WHY POLYGON SHOWS "ONE CONNECTION"**

### **‚úÖ POLYGON DASHBOARD IS CORRECT**
**Polygon shows "one connection" because:**
- **Old system**: Already connected (using the connection)
- **New system**: Trying to connect (gets rejected)
- **Result**: Only one active connection, but limit is reached

### **‚úÖ THE CONNECTION LIMIT IS PER ACCOUNT**
**Even with different keys on the same account, the limit applies to the account level, not per key.**

---

## üéØ **FINAL CONCLUSION**

**‚úÖ YOU'RE RIGHT - POLYGON LOOKS FINE**

**‚úÖ THE ISSUE IS BOTH SYSTEMS RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY**

**üî• IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUSPEND THE OLD SYSTEM**

**‚úÖ ONCE OLD SYSTEM IS SUSPENDED, NEW SYSTEM WILL WORK PERFECTLY**

**üéØ THE NEW SYSTEM IS PERFECTLY CONFIGURED - JUST NEED TO FREE UP THE CONNECTION!**
